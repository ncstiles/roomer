# Roomer

Implemented:
- Reactive navbar.  Currently linking only works via clicking on the Roomer logo.  
- Grid view, displaying each user's basic information.  Also reactive.
- Single card view containing a user-controlled slideshow of basic information, preferences, and a short bio.  Numbers and dots indicate which page of the slideshow the user is on.
  Also reactive.  Scrollbar added in the case of overfill text.
