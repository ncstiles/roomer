# Roomer

Implemented:

[CURRENT] Feature 3: Moving to MongoDB
- Moved database from db.json to MongoDB

Feature 2: Login + registration forms
- Created new endpoints to get all user's basic data, as well as individual user's basic, housing, preference, and extra info.
- Added (reactive) login and registration form, built off of Bootstrap.  Login form is purely UI, while registration form updates the backend.

Feature 1: Card views
- Reactive navbar.  Currently linking only works via clicking on the Roomer logo.  
- Grid view, displaying each user's basic information.  Also reactive.
- Single card view containing a user-controlled (reactive) slideshow of basic information, preferences, and a short bio.  Numbers and dots indicate which page of the slideshow the user is on.  Scrollbar added in the case of overfill text.
